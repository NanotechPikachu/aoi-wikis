# Wiki #NP002 - Remind command

Hi to all of you. I am back with yet another command which I believe would be useful to you guys. And that is... **remind command.**

The command simply reminds you of things that you say the bot to remind. It's technically like the one which Carl-bot has but, the aoi way. 

Let's get to the command. See the `remind.js` code to see it.

### Remind
I will just add the syntax and images as the others are self explanatory. It just DMs you on the time when you say it to be reminded.

<u>Syntax</u>

`(prefix) remind [time] [message you wanna be reminded]`

The syntax of time is like 1d/1w/1m etc with a maximum of 21 days.
