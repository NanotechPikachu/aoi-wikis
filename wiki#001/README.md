### Role Info
This will return an embed message with the information of a role like role name, role position, creation date, manageable, etc.

### Role Remove-All
This is a slash command which removes **all roles from a selected user.** Yeah, it removes all of their roles hence, the condition to use is to have role higher than the highest role of the user whose role you wanna remove. Also, you can't use this command on a bot cuz one of their role is managed which will cause an error.

![roleRemoveAll.js](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1149961478372347985/1149964783781691452/Screenshot_20230909_123902_Discord.jpg)

**Note**: All the commands are accompanied with error checking and permission checks.
